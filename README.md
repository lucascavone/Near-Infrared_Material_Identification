# Material Identification Through Near-Infrared Spectroscopy

This project was the main focus of my Grade 11 Personal Project. My goal was to apply near-infrared spectroscopy to the recycling industry as an efficient and reliable way to identify and sort plastics. Every year, nearly 300 million tons of plastic are discarded as waste with only 9% being recycled. Unfortunately, the same properties that make plastics useful –durability, malleability, weight and cost– also make them extremely resistant to corrosion and degradation. Plastic pollution has caused irreparable damage to our oceans and ecosystems, justifying an increasing need to recycle the millions of tons of plastic waste generated every year.
